TOPICS REQUIRED: C Expressions, Functions

You are given functions, expOne and expTwo.
Create the required expressions using
logical and arithmetic operators, and the
function parameters only. Use the documentation
of each function as a guide to answering the problem.

You CANNOT compile and execute the program to test
whether the function works as expected.

	function expTwo
	
	This function takes in three parameters, x, y, z,
	which returns a truth value on whether the sum of x and y
	is equal to z and z is an even number or that the product
	of x and y is divisible by z + 1 and the product is a
	positive integer.
	
	Parameters:
	-> int x	- An integer.
	-> int y	- An integer.
	-> int z	- An integer. Assume it is a nonnegative number.

	function expOne
	
	This function takes in two parameters, a and b,
	which returns a truth value on whether the sum of the squares
	of a and b is not less than the remainder of the product
	of b and c divided by c.
	
	Parameters:
	-> int a	- An integer.
	-> int b	- An integer.
	-> int c	- An integer. Assume it is a positive number.
